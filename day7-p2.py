Write a Python class named Circle constructed by a radius and two methods which will compute the area and the perimeter of a circle.



class Circle():
    def area(self,r):
        print("area of the circle is:",3.14*r**2)
    def peri(self,p):
        print("perimeter of the circle is:",2*3.14*p)
        
obj=Circle()
obj.area(3)
obj.peri(3)
