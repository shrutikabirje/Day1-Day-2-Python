Create a function showStudent() in such a way that it should accept student id, name, and itâ€™s college name  and if the id and college name is missing in function call it should show it as by default id is 1 and college name  is VITA.



def student(name,clgname="Vita",id=1):
    print(name,"studying in",clgname,", your id is",id)
    
student("shrutika","vita",7)
student("adi")
student("apurva","vita")
